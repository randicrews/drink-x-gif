# DRINK x GIF
A step up from my previous experiment with web APIs, this app fetches a random drink from TheCoctailDB and uses that data to fetch a matching gif from Giphy's API.

## TAKEAWAY
Through building this app, I experimented with using fetched data to fetch more data from web APIs. I also had a lot of fun displaying that data in the DOM by adding the gifs to a cocktail glass to match the theme.
